Edge detection Matlab Script for creating split depth gif's

The Licesnse file is for the gifread and gifwrite functions. I did not make said functions, and found them here:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52514-tools-to-read-and-write-animated-gif-files/content/gifread.m
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52514-tools-to-read-and-write-animated-gif-files/content/gifwrite.m

These functions are nescesary for the script to work.

An example gif is included. NOTE: This script only works with images with clear in focus foregrounds and out of focus backgrounds, and may need to be manually adjusted via edge detection method (see commented code) or frame by frame.
